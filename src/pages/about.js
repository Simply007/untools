                    <p>
                        I'm a product designer from Brno, <span role="img" aria-label="Czechia">ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿</span> and a maker of Untools.

                        Let me tell you why I created this little site.

                <img src="/adam.png" alt="Portrait of Adam Amran" style={{float: `left`, marginLeft: `2rem`}}></img>

            <p>
                As a designer, I'm paid for good thinking. I solve problems and make decisions on day-to-day basis.
                A while ago, I began to look into purposefully improving my thinking. 
                There are plenty of digital design tools, but they are not enough. 
                I couldn't find one place that would offer a good overview of thinking tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eventually, I found plenty of these tools, but scattered around the web.
                My goal is to build a collection of tools and frameworks, covering areas like problem solving, systems thinking or decision making.
                I started building it for myself, but I hope it will be useful to many of you.
            </p>
